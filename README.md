# bsod-tribute
This is a program made in Raylib C++. It is a tribute to the Windows BSOD Error, which was removed by Microsoft.
It shows a BSOD made with DrawTextEx functions. It has a sad face emoticon, error message, and complete percentage. 
The program also has the default Windows 10 blue accent color.
The repo also contains a `raylib.dll` file. However, it is not required to be used, as the executable included is statically linked.
